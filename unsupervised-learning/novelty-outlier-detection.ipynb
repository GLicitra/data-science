    "- it flags data which they don't look like the data which we have seen before.\n",
    "- Anomaly samples must be **absent** during training and they should appear only on the test set;\n",
    "- Novelty detection are also known as **One-class classification** becasue only one class (the normal one) is present in the training data;\n",
    "- **One-class Support Vector Machine** can be tuned accessing the raw score via `clf.score_samples(X_test)`. The lower is the value, the more anomalous is the data point.\n",
    "- **Isolation Forest** is a modificiation of random forest for anomaly detection.\n",
    "- The **sensitivity** of novelty detection algorithms on the choice of threshold should be done on the raw score using `roc_auc_score`."
